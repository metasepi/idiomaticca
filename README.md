# Idiomaticca: translate IDIOMATIC C into readable ATS

## What's this?

[ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org/) is a statically typed programming language that unifies implementation with formal specification. It can powerfully capture invariant in program.

However, there are already many C language codes, which shape unsafe application. Should we manually rewrite the code with ATS to get safe application? No, it need so much human resource.

This program is a translator from C code to ATS code, which is human-readable. The translated code should be maintained by human, not for machine. You may manually add some formal specifications to the code after translating.

## Requirements

* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) to parse C language header
* [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org/) to build [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) code
* [ATS-Postiats](http://www.ats-lang.org/) to compile ATS code generated by idiomaticca

We are testing this tool on [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/).

## Install

Checkout source code of the idiomaticca:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/metasepi/idiomaticca.git
$ cd idiomaticca
```

Then install it using stack:

```
$ make install
$ which idiomaticca
/home/YourName/.local/bin/idiomaticca
```

## Usage

Start from [simple example](./regress/noinc/arithmetic_op/).

```
$ cat regress/noinc/arithmetic_op/main.c
int main() {
        return 1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 4;
}
```

Translate the C code into ATS:

```
$ idiomaticca regress/noinc/arithmetic_op/main.c > main.dats
$ cat main.dats
#include "share/atspre_staload.hats"

implement main () =
  1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 4
```

Compile the ATS code and run it:

```
$ patscc main.dats
$ ls a.out main*
a.out*  main.dats  main_dats.c
$ ./a.out
$ echo $?
0
```

`idiomaticca` command line option will be changed, and not stable today.

The other examples are found at [regress](./regress/) directory.

## FAQ

### What license will be applied to the C code translated by idiomaticca?

AGPL-3 or later with your copyright.

Example: if you translate your C code published under BSD license, the translated C code should published AGPL-3 or later.

### Are there another option to apply a license other than the other AGPL-3?

Yes. You can apply your own license to your C code translated by idiomaticca. Please contact Metasepi Team <metasepi@gmail.com>.
